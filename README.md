# GLEAM
## A Minecraft shaderpack
Gleam is a Minecraft shaderpack written by me. It's currently **very** early in development, so don't download it and expect anything that's playable.
### Is it fast?
Probably not.
### Does it look good?
Not really.

But I made it from scratch, so there's that. Maybe one day it'll be half decent.

## Compatibility
This should work on modern versions of Iris. It hasn't been tested on Optifine. MacOS is not supported.
